# Logistic Regression from Scratch: Predicting Heart Disease

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using numpy and pandas. The dataset used is predict_heart_disease, focusing on predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various health-related attributes. The implementation includes foundational steps of machine learning, such as data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

## Features:
- Built entirely from scratch without external libraries like scikit-learn.
- Handles numerical and categorical attributes effectively.
- Implements key machine learning functionalities:
- Data preprocessing (scaling, handling missing values).
- Training and testing split.
- Gradient descent optimization for logistic regression.
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy and confusion matrix.
